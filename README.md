## Problems
Create a playable version of the board game Mastermind. Allow the player to choose to be either the codemaker or codebreaker. When playing as codebreaker, accept string input guesses and provide appropriate feedback on the correctness of the guess. End the game when appropriate. When playing as the codemaker, have the CPU intelligently guess and end the game when appropriate

## What I used
